[<p><a class="external text" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6Tlp9Gx4lfo" rel="nofollow">Delivered on 24 January 2012</a>, the speech was Obama's third official <a class="extiw" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/State_of_the_Union_address" title="w:State of the Union address">State of the Union address</a>.
</p>, <p>Thank you, thank you.  Everybody, please be seated.  <a class="extiw" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Boehner" title="wikipedia:John Boehner">Mr. Speaker</a>, <a class="extiw" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joe_Biden" title="wikipedia:Joe Biden">Mr. Vice President</a>, members of Congress, distinguished guests, and fellow <a class="extiw" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Americans" title="w:Americans">Americans</a>:
</p>, <p>Last month, I went to <a class="extiw" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joint_Base_Andrews" title="wikipedia:Joint Base Andrews">Andrews Air Force Base</a> and welcomed home some of our last troops to serve in <a class="extiw" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Iraq" title="wikipedia:Iraq">Iraq</a>. Together, we offered a final, proud salute to the colors under which more than a million of our fellow citizens fought, and several thousand gave their lives.  We gather tonight knowing that this generation of heroes has made the United States safer and more respected around the world.
</p>, <p>For the first time in nine years, there are no Americans fighting in Iraq.  For the first time in two decades, <a class="extiw" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Osama_bin_Laden" title="w:Osama bin Laden">Osama bin Laden</a> is not a threat to this country.  Most of <a class="extiw" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/al-Qaeda" title="w:al-Qaeda">al-Qaeda</a>’s top lieutenants have been defeated.  The <a class="extiw" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Taliban" title="w:Taliban">Taliban</a>’s momentum has been broken, and some troops in <a class="extiw" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Afghanistan" title="w:Afghanistan">Afghanistan</a> have begun to come home.  These achievements are a testament to the courage, selflessness, and teamwork of <a class="extiw" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States" title="w:United States">America</a>’s <a class="extiw" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Armed_Forces" title="w:United States Armed Forces">Armed Forces</a>. <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Barack_Obama_Weekly_Address_-_28_January_2012" title="Barack Obama Weekly Address - 28 January 2012">At a time when too many of our institutions have let us down, they exceed all expectations.  They’re not consumed with personal ambition.  They don’t obsess over their differences.  They focus on the mission at hand.  They work together</a>.   Imagine what we could accomplish if we followed their example.
</p>, <p>Think about the America within our reach: a country that leads the world in educating its people.  An America that attracts a new generation of high-tech manufacturing and high-paying jobs.  A future where we’re in control of our own energy, and our security and prosperity aren’t so tied to unstable parts of the world.  An economy built to last, <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Barack_Obama_Weekly_Address_-_17_December_2011" title="Barack Obama Weekly Address - 17 December 2011">where hard work pays off, and responsibility is rewarded</a>.  We can do this. I know we can, because we’ve done it before.  At the end of <a class="extiw" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/World_War_II" title="w:World War II">World War II</a>, when <a class="extiw" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Greatest_Generation" title="w:Greatest Generation">another generation of heroes</a> returned home from combat, they built the strongest economy and middle class the world has ever known.
</p>, <p>My <a class="extiw" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stanley_Armour_Dunham" title="w:Stanley Armour Dunham">grandfather</a>, a veteran of <a class="extiw" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/George_S._Patton" title="w:George S. Patton">Patton</a>’s Army, got the chance to go to college on the <a class="extiw" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/G.I._Bill" title="w:G.I. Bill">G.I. Bill</a>. My <a class="extiw" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Madelyn_Dunham" title="w:Madelyn Dunham">grandmother</a>, who worked on a bomber assembly line, was part of a workforce that turned out the best products on Earth. The two of them shared the optimism of a nation that had triumphed over a <a class="extiw" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Great_Depression" title="w:Great Depression">depression</a> and <a class="extiw" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fascism" title="w:Fascism">fascism</a>. They understood they were part of something larger; that they were contributing to a story of success that every American had a chance to share – the basic American promise that if you worked hard, you could do well enough to raise a family, <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Barack_Obama_Weekly_Address_-_17_December_2011" title="Barack Obama Weekly Address - 17 December 2011">own a home, send your kids to college, and put a little away for retirement</a>. 
</p>, <p>The defining issue of our time is how to keep that promise alive. No challenge is more urgent. No debate is more important. We can either settle for a country where a shrinking number of people do really well, while a growing number of Americans barely get by, or we can restore an economy where everyone gets a fair shot, and everyone does their fair share, and everyone plays by the same set of rules.
</p>, <p>What’s at stake aren't Democratic values or Republican values, but American values.  And we have to reclaim them.  Let’s remember how we got here.  Long before the <a class="extiw" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2007%E2%80%93present_recession_in_the_United_States" title="w:2007–present recession in the United States">recession</a>, jobs and manufacturing began leaving our shores.  Technology made businesses more efficient, but also made some jobs obsolete.  Folks at the top saw their incomes rise like never before, but most hardworking Americans struggled with costs that were growing, paychecks that weren’t, and personal debt that kept piling up.
</p>, <p>In <a class="extiw" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2008" title="w:2008">2008</a>, the house of cards collapsed. We learned that <a class="extiw" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Subprime_mortgage_crisis" title="w:Subprime mortgage crisis">mortgages had been sold to people who couldn’t afford or understand them</a>. Banks had made huge bets and bonuses with other people’s money. Regulators had looked the other way, or didn’t have the authority to stop the bad behavior.  It was wrong. It was irresponsible. And it plunged our economy into a crisis that put millions out of work, saddled us with more debt, and left innocent, hard-working Americans holding the bag. In the six months before I took office, we lost nearly four million jobs, and we lost another four million before our policies were in full effect.  Those are the facts.  But so are these.  In the last 22 months, businesses have created more than three million jobs.
</p>, <p>Last year, they created the most jobs since <a class="extiw" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2005" title="w:2005">2005</a>. American manufacturers are hiring again, creating jobs for the first time since the late-<a class="extiw" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1990s" title="w:1990s">1990s</a>. Together, we’ve agreed to cut the <a class="extiw" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Government_debt" title="w:Government debt">deficit</a> by more than two-trillion dollars. And we’ve put in place new rules to hold <a class="extiw" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wall_Street" title="w:Wall Street">Wall Street</a> accountable, so a crisis like this never happens again. 
</p>, <p>The state of our Union is getting stronger, and we’ve come too far to turn back now. As long as I’m <a class="extiw" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/President_of_the_United_States" title="w:President of the United States">President</a>, I will work with anyone in this chamber to build on this momentum. But I intend to fight obstruction with action, and I will oppose any effort to return to the very same policies that brought on this economic crisis in the first place. 
</p>, <p>No.  We will not go back to an economy weakened by <a class="extiw" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Outsourcing" title="w:Outsourcing">outsourcing</a>, bad debt, and phony financial profits. Tonight, I want to speak about how we move forward, and lay out a blueprint for an economy that’s built to last.  An economy built on American manufacturing, American energy, skills for American workers, and a renewal of American values.
</p>, <p>Now, this blueprint begins with American manufacturing.  On the day I took office, our auto industry was on the verge of collapse. Some even said we should let it die. With a million jobs at stake, I refused to let that happen. In exchange for help, we demanded responsibility. We got workers and automakers to settle their differences. We got the industry to retool and restructure. Today, <a class="extiw" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/General_Motors" title="w:General Motors">General Motors</a> is back on top as the world’s number one automaker.
</p>, <p><a class="extiw" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chrysler" title="w:Chrysler">Chrysler</a> has grown faster in the U.S. than any major car company. <a class="extiw" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ford_Motor_Company" title="w:Ford Motor Company">Ford</a> is investing billions in U.S. plants and factories. And together, the entire industry added nearly 160,000 jobs.  We bet on American workers.  We bet on American ingenuity.  And tonight, the American auto industry is back. 
</p>, <p>What’s happening in <a class="extiw" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Detroit" title="w:Detroit">Detroit</a> can happen in other industries. It can happen in <a class="extiw" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cleveland" title="w:Cleveland">Cleveland</a> and <a class="extiw" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pittsburgh" title="w:Pittsburgh">Pittsburgh</a> and <a class="extiw" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Raleigh,_North_Carolina" title="w:Raleigh, North Carolina">Raleigh</a>. We can’t bring back every job that’s left our shores. But right now, it’s getting more expensive to do business in places like <a class="extiw" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/China" title="w:China">China</a>. Meanwhile, America is more productive. A few weeks ago, the <a class="extiw" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chief_Executive_Officer" title="w:Chief Executive Officer">CEO</a> of <a class="extiw" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Master_Lock" title="w:Master Lock">Master Lock</a> told me that it now makes business sense for him to bring jobs back home. Today, for the first time in fifteen years, Master Lock’s unionized plant in <a class="extiw" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Milwaukee" title="w:Milwaukee">Milwaukee</a> is running at full capacity.
</p>, <p>So we have a huge opportunity, at this moment, to bring manufacturing back. But we have to seize it. Tonight, my message to business leaders is simple: ask yourselves what you can do to bring jobs back to your country, and your country will do everything we can to help you succeed. 
</p>, <p>We should start with our <a class="extiw" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Internal_Revenue_Code" title="w:Internal Revenue Code">tax code</a>. Right now, companies get tax breaks for moving jobs and profits overseas. Meanwhile, companies that choose to stay in America get hit with one of the highest tax rates in the world. It makes no sense, and everyone knows it. 
</p>, <p>So let’s change it. First, if you’re a business that wants to outsource jobs, you shouldn’t get a tax deduction for doing it. That money should be used to cover moving expenses for companies like Master Lock that decide to bring jobs home.
</p>, <p>Second, no American company should be able to avoid paying its fair share of taxes by moving jobs and profits overseas. From now on, every <a class="extiw" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Multinational_corporation" title="w:Multinational corporation">multinational company</a> should have to pay a basic minimum tax. And every penny should go towards lowering taxes for companies that choose to stay here and hire here.
</p>, <p>Third, if you’re an American manufacturer, you should get a bigger tax cut. If you’re a high-tech manufacturer, we should double the tax deduction you get for making products here. And if you want to relocate in a community that was hit hard when a factory left town, you should get help financing a new plant, equipment, or training for new workers.
</p>, <p>My message is simple. It’s time to stop rewarding businesses that ship jobs overseas, and start rewarding companies that create jobs right here in America. Send me these tax reforms, and I’ll sign them right away.  
</p>, <p>We’re also making it easier for American businesses to sell products all over the world. Two years ago, I set a goal of doubling U.S. exports over five years. With the bipartisan trade agreements I signed into law, we are on track to meet that goal ahead of schedule. Soon, there will be millions of new customers for American goods in <a class="extiw" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Panama" title="w:Panama">Panama</a>, <a class="extiw" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Colombia" title="w:Colombia">Colombia</a>, and <a class="extiw" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/South_Korea" title="w:South Korea">South Korea</a>. Soon, there will be new cars on the streets of <a class="extiw" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Seoul" title="w:Seoul">Seoul</a> imported from <a class="extiw" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Detroit" title="w:Detroit">Detroit</a>, and <a class="extiw" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Toledo,_Ohio" title="w:Toledo, Ohio">Toledo</a>, and <a class="extiw" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chicago" title="w:Chicago">Chicago</a>.   
</p>, <p>I will go anywhere in the world to open new markets for American products. And I will not stand by when our competitors don’t play by the rules. We’ve brought trade cases against <a class="extiw" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/China" title="w:China">China</a> at nearly twice the rate as the last administration, and it’s made a difference. Over a thousand Americans are working today because we stopped a surge in Chinese tires. But we need to do more. It’s not right when another country lets our movies, music, and software be pirated. It’s not fair when foreign manufacturers have a leg up on ours only because they’re heavily subsidized.
</p>, <p>Tonight, I’m announcing the creation of a Trade Enforcement Unit that will be charged with investigating unfair trade practices in countries like China. There will be more inspections to prevent counterfeit or unsafe goods from crossing our borders. And this Congress should make sure that no foreign company has an advantage over American manufacturing when it comes to accessing finance or new markets like <a class="extiw" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Russia" title="w:Russia">Russia</a>. Our workers are the most productive on Earth, and if the playing field is level, I promise you: America will always win.
</p>, <p>I also hear from many business leaders who want to hire in the United States but can’t find workers with the right skills. Growing industries in science and technology have twice as many openings as we have workers who can do the job. Think about that: openings at a time when millions of Americans are looking for work.  
</p>, <p>That’s inexcusable. And we know how to fix it.
</p>, <p>Jackie Bray is a single mom from <a class="extiw" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/North_Carolina" title="w:North Carolina">North Carolina</a> who was laid off from her job as a mechanic. Then <a class="extiw" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Siemens" title="w:Siemens">Siemens</a> opened a <a class="extiw" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gas_turbine" title="w:Gas turbine">gas turbine</a> factory in <a class="extiw" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Charlotte,_North_Carolina" title="w:Charlotte, North Carolina">Charlotte</a>, and formed a partnership with <a class="extiw" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Central_Piedmont_Community_College" title="w:Central Piedmont Community College">Central Piedmont Community College</a>. The company helped the college design courses in laser and robotics training. It paid Jackie’s tuition, then hired her to help operate their plant.<sup class="reference" id="cite_ref-1"><a href="#cite_note-1">[1]</a></sup>
</p>, <p>I want every American looking for work to have the same opportunity as Jackie did. Join me in a national commitment to train two million Americans with skills that will lead directly to a job. My Administration has already lined up more companies that want to help. Model partnerships between businesses like Siemens and community colleges in places like <a class="extiw" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Charlotte,_North_Carolina" title="w:Charlotte, North Carolina">Charlotte</a>, <a class="extiw" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Orlando,_Florida" title="w:Orlando, Florida">Orlando</a>, and <a class="extiw" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Louisville,_Kentucky" title="w:Louisville, Kentucky">Louisville</a> are up and running.  Now you need to give more community colleges the resources they need to become community career centers: places that teach people skills that local businesses are looking for right now, from data management to high-tech manufacturing. 
</p>, <p>And I want to cut through the maze of confusing training programs, so that from now on, people like Jackie have one program, one website, and one place to go for all the information and help they need. It’s time to turn our unemployment system into a reemployment system that puts people to work.  
</p>, <p>These reforms will help people get jobs that are open today. But to prepare for the jobs of tomorrow, our commitment to skills and <a class="extiw" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Education_in_the_United_States" title="w:Education in the United States">education</a> has to start earlier. For less than one-percent of what our Nation spends on education each year, we’ve convinced nearly every State in the country to raise their standards for teaching and learning – the first time that’s happened in a generation. But challenges remain. And we know how to solve them.
</p>, <p>At a time when other countries are <a class="extiw" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Double_down" title="w:Double down">doubling down</a> on education, tight budgets have forced States to lay off thousands of teachers. We know a good teacher can increase the lifetime income of a classroom by over $250,000. A great teacher can offer an escape from poverty to the child who dreams beyond his circumstance.  Every person in this chamber can point to a teacher who changed the trajectory of their lives. Most teachers work tirelessly, with modest pay, sometimes digging into their own pocket for school supplies, just to make a difference. 
</p>, <p>Teachers matter. So instead of bashing them, or defending the <i><a class="extiw" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Status_quo" title="w:Status quo">status quo</a></i>, let’s offer schools a deal. Give them the resources to keep good teachers on the job, and reward the best ones. In return, grant schools flexibility: to teach with creativity and passion; to stop <a class="extiw" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/No_Child_Left_Behind_Act" title="w:No Child Left Behind Act">teaching to the test</a>; and to replace teachers who just aren’t helping kids learn. That's a bargain worth making.
</p>, <p>We also know that when students aren’t allowed to walk away from their education, more of them walk the stage to get their diploma. When students are not allowed to drop out, they do better. So tonight, I call on every State to require that all students stay in high school until they graduate or turn eighteen.
</p>, <p>When kids do graduate, the most daunting challenge can be the cost of college. At a time when Americans owe more in tuition debt than credit card debt, this Congress needs to stop the interest rates on student loans from doubling in July. Extend the tuition tax credit we started that saves middle-class families thousands of dollars. And give more young people the chance to earn their way through college by doubling the number of <a class="extiw" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cooperative_education" title="w:Cooperative education">work-study</a> jobs in the next five years.
</p>, <p>Of course, it’s not enough for us to increase student aid. We can’t just keep subsidizing skyrocketing tuition; we’ll run out of money. States also need to do their part, by making <a class="extiw" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Higher_education_in_the_United_States" title="w:Higher education in the United States">higher education</a> a higher priority in their budgets. And colleges and universities have to do their part by working to keep costs down. Recently, I spoke with a group of college presidents who’ve done just that. Some schools re-design courses to help students finish more quickly. Some use better technology. The point is, it’s possible. So let me put colleges and universities on notice: if you can’t stop tuition from going up, the funding you get from taxpayers will go down. Higher education can’t be a luxury.  It’s an economic imperative that every family in America should be able to afford.
</p>, <p>Let’s also remember that hundreds of thousands of talented, hardworking students in this country face another challenge: the fact that they aren’t yet <a class="extiw" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Citizenship_in_the_United_States" title="w:Citizenship in the United States">American citizens</a>. Many were brought here as small children, are American through and through, yet they live every day with the threat of <a class="extiw" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Deportation" title="w:Deportation">deportation</a>. Others came more recently, to study business and science and engineering, but as soon as they get their degree, we send them home to invent new products and create new jobs somewhere else. 
</p>, <p>That doesn’t make sense.
</p>, <p>I believe as strongly as ever that we should take on <a class="extiw" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Illegal_immigration_to_the_United_States" title="w:Illegal immigration to the United States">illegal immigration</a>. That’s why my Administration has put more boots on the border than ever before. That’s why there are fewer illegal crossings than when I took office. 
</p>, <p>The opponents of action are out of excuses. We should be working on comprehensive <a class="extiw" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Immigration_reform#Immigration_reform_in_the_United_States" title="w:Immigration reform">immigration reform</a> right now.  But if election-year politics keeps Congress from acting on a comprehensive plan, let’s at least agree to stop expelling responsible young people who want to staff our labs, start new businesses, and defend this country. Send me a law that gives them the chance to earn their citizenship. I will sign it right away.
</p>, <p>You see, an economy built to last is one where we encourage the talent and ingenuity of every person in this country. That means women should earn equal pay for equal work. It means we should support everyone who’s willing to work; and every risk-taker and entrepreneur who aspires to become the next <a class="extiw" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Steve_Jobs" title="w:Steve Jobs">Steve Jobs</a>.
</p>, <p>After all, innovation is what America has always been about. Most new jobs are created in <a class="extiw" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Startup_company" title="w:Startup company">start-ups</a> and <a class="extiw" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Small_business" title="w:Small business">small businesses</a>. So let’s pass an agenda that helps them succeed. Tear down regulations that prevent aspiring entrepreneurs from getting the financing to grow. Expand tax relief to small businesses that are raising wages and creating good jobs. Both parties agree on these ideas. So put them in a bill, and get it on my desk this year. 
</p>, <p>Innovation also demands basic research. Today, the discoveries taking place in our federally-financed labs and universities could lead to new treatments that kill cancer cells but leave healthy ones untouched. New lightweight vests for cops and soldiers that can stop any bullet. Don’t gut these investments in our budget. Don’t let other countries win the race for the future. Support the same kind of research and innovation that led to the <a class="extiw" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Integrated_circuit" title="w:Integrated circuit">computer chip</a> and the <a class="extiw" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Internet" title="w:Internet">Internet</a>; to new American jobs and new American industries.
</p>, <p>Nowhere is the promise of innovation greater than in American-made energy. Over the last three years, we’ve opened millions of new acres for <a class="extiw" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fossil_fuel" title="w:Fossil fuel">oil and gas</a> exploration, and tonight, I’m directing my Administration to open more than 75% of our potential offshore oil and gas resources. Right now, American oil production is the highest that it’s been in eight years. That’s right: eight years. Not only that: last year, we relied less on foreign oil than in any of the past sixteen years.
</p>, <p>But with only two-percent of the world’s oil reserves, oil isn’t enough. This country needs an all-out, all-of-the-above strategy that develops every available source of American energy, a strategy that’s cleaner, cheaper, and full of new jobs. 
</p>, <p>We have a supply of <a class="extiw" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Natural_gas" title="w:Natural gas">natural gas</a> that can last America nearly one hundred years, and my Administration will take every possible action to safely develop this energy. Experts believe this will support more than 600,000 jobs by the end of the decade. And I’m requiring all companies that drill for gas on public lands to disclose the chemicals they use. America will develop this resource without putting the health and safety of our citizens at risk.
</p>, <p>The development of natural gas will create jobs and power trucks and factories that are cleaner and cheaper, proving that we don’t have to choose between our environment and our economy. And by the way, it was public research dollars, over the course of thirty years, that helped develop the technologies to extract all this natural gas out of shale rock, reminding us that Government support is critical in helping businesses get new energy ideas off the ground.
</p>, <p>What’s true for natural gas is true for <a class="extiw" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sustainable_energy" title="w:Sustainable energy">clean energy</a>. In three years, our partnership with the private sector has already positioned America to be the world’s leading manufacturer of high-tech batteries. Because of federal investments, renewable energy use has nearly doubled. And thousands of Americans have jobs because of it. 
</p>, <p>When Bryan Ritterby was laid off from his job making furniture, he said he worried that at 55, no one would give him a second chance. But he found work at Energetx, a <a class="extiw" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wind_turbine" title="w:Wind turbine">wind turbine</a> manufacturer in <a class="extiw" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Michigan" title="w:Michigan">Michigan</a>. Before the recession, the factory only made luxury yachts. Today, it’s hiring workers like Bryan, who said, “I’m proud to be working in the industry of the future.”<sup class="reference" id="cite_ref-2"><a href="#cite_note-2">[2]</a></sup>
</p>, <p>Our experience with <a class="extiw" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shale_gas" title="w:Shale gas">shale gas</a> shows us that the payoffs on these public investments don’t always come right away. Some technologies don’t pan out; some companies fail. But I will not walk away from the promise of clean energy. I will not walk away from workers like Bryan. I will not cede the <a class="extiw" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wind_energy" title="w:Wind energy">wind</a> or <a class="extiw" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Solar_energy" title="w:Solar energy">solar</a> or battery industry to <a class="extiw" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/China" title="w:China">China</a> or <a class="extiw" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Germany" title="w:Germany">Germany</a> because we refuse to make the same commitment here. We have subsidized oil companies for a century. That’s long enough. It’s time to end the taxpayer giveaways to an industry that’s rarely been more profitable, and double-down on a <a class="extiw" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sustainable_energy" title="w:Sustainable energy">clean energy</a> industry that’s never been more promising.  Pass clean energy tax credits and create these jobs.  
</p>, <p>We can also spur energy innovation with new incentives. The differences in this chamber may be too deep right now to pass a comprehensive plan to fight <a class="extiw" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Climate_change" title="w:Climate change">climate change</a>. But there’s no reason why Congress shouldn’t at least set a clean energy standard that creates a market for innovation. So far, you haven’t acted. Well tonight, I will. I’m directing my Administration to allow the development of clean energy on enough public land to power three million homes. And I’m proud to announce that the <a class="extiw" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Department_of_Defense" title="w:United States Department of Defense">Department of Defense</a>, the world’s largest consumer of energy, will make one of the largest commitments to clean energy in history, with the <a class="extiw" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Navy" title="w:United States Navy">Navy</a> purchasing enough capacity to power a quarter of a million homes a year.
</p>, <p>Of course, the easiest way to save money is to waste less energy. So here’s another proposal: help manufacturers eliminate energy waste in their factories and give businesses incentives to upgrade their buildings. Their energy bills will be $100 billion lower over the next decade, and America will have less pollution, more manufacturing, and more jobs for construction workers who need them. Send me a bill that creates these jobs. 
</p>, <p>Building this new energy future should be just one part of a broader agenda to repair America’s infrastructure. So much of America needs to be rebuilt. We’ve got crumbling roads and bridges. A <a class="extiw" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electrical_grid" title="w:Electrical grid">power grid</a> that wastes too much energy. An incomplete <a class="extiw" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Internet_access" title="w:Internet access">high-speed</a> <a class="extiw" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Broadband" title="w:Broadband">broadband</a> network that prevents a small business owner in rural America from selling her products all over the world. 
</p>, <p>During the Great Depression, America built the <a class="extiw" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hoover_Dam" title="w:Hoover Dam">Hoover Dam</a> and the <a class="extiw" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Golden_Gate_Bridge" title="w:Golden Gate Bridge">Golden Gate Bridge</a>. After World War II, we connected our States with a <a class="extiw" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Interstate_Highway_System" title="w:Interstate Highway System">system of highways</a>. Democratic and Republican administrations invested in great projects that benefited everybody, from the workers who built them to the businesses that still use them today.
</p>, <p>In the next few weeks, I will sign an <a class="extiw" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Executive_Order" title="w:Executive Order">executive order</a> clearing away the red tape that slows down too many construction projects. But you need to fund these projects. Take the money we’re no longer spending at war, use half of it to pay down our debt, and use the rest to do some <a class="extiw" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nation-building" title="w:Nation-building">nation-building</a> right here at home.
</p>, <p>There’s never been a better time to build, especially since the construction industry was one of the hardest-hit when the housing bubble burst. Of course, construction workers weren’t the only ones hurt. So were millions of innocent Americans who’ve seen their home values decline. And while Government can’t fix the problem on its own, responsible homeowners shouldn’t have to sit and wait for the housing market to hit bottom to get some relief.
</p>, <p>That’s why I’m sending this Congress a plan that gives every responsible homeowner the chance to save about $3,000 a year on their mortgage, by refinancing at historically low interest rates. No more red tape. No more runaround from the banks. A small fee on the largest financial institutions will ensure that it won’t add to the deficit, and will give banks that were rescued by taxpayers a chance to repay a deficit of trust.
</p>, <p>Let’s never forget: millions of Americans who work hard and play by the rules every day deserve a Government and a financial system that do the same. It’s time to apply the same rules from top to bottom: no bailouts, no handouts, and no copouts. An America built to last insists on responsibility from everybody. 
</p>, <p>We’ve all paid the price for lenders who sold mortgages to people who couldn’t afford them, and buyers who knew they couldn’t afford them. That’s why we need smart regulations to prevent irresponsible behavior. Rules to prevent financial fraud or toxic dumping or faulty medical devices don’t destroy the <a class="extiw" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Free_market" title="w:Free market">free market</a>. They make the free market work better.  
</p>, <p>There is no question that some regulations are outdated, unnecessary, or too costly. In fact, I’ve approved fewer regulations in the first three years of my presidency than my Republican <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Author:George_W._Bush" title="Author:George W. Bush">predecessor</a> did in his. I’ve ordered every federal agency to eliminate rules that don’t make sense. We’ve already announced over 500 reforms, and just a fraction of them will save business and citizens more than ten-billion dollars over the next five years. We got rid of one rule from forty years ago that could have forced some dairy farmers to spend $10,000 a year proving that they could contain a spill, because <a class="extiw" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Milk" title="w:Milk">milk</a> was somehow classified as an oil. With a rule like that, I guess it was worth <a class="extiw" href="https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/don%27t_cry_over_spilt_milk" title="wiktionary:don't cry over spilt milk">crying over spilled milk</a>.
</p>, <p>I’m confident a farmer can contain a milk spill without a federal agency looking over his shoulder. But I will not back down from making sure an oil company can contain <a class="extiw" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Deepwater_Horizon_oil_spill" title="w:Deepwater Horizon oil spill">the kind of oil spill</a> we saw in <a class="extiw" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gulf_of_Mexico" title="w:Gulf of Mexico">the Gulf</a> <a class="extiw" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2010" title="w:2010">two years ago</a>. I will not back down from protecting our kids from <a class="extiw" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mercury_(element)" title="w:Mercury (element)">mercury</a> pollution, or making sure that our food is safe and our water is clean. I will not go back to the days when <a class="extiw" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Health_insurance_in_the_United_States" title="w:Health insurance in the United States">health insurance companies</a> had unchecked power to cancel your policy, deny you coverage, or charge women differently from men. 
</p>, <p>And I will not go back to the days when <a class="extiw" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wall_Street" title="w:Wall Street">Wall Street</a> was allowed to play by its own set of rules. The new rules we passed restore what should be any financial system’s core purpose: getting funding to entrepreneurs with the best ideas, and getting loans to responsible families who want to buy a home, start a business, or send a kid to college.
</p>, <p>So if you’re a big bank or financial institution, you are no longer allowed to make risky bets with your customers’ deposits. You’re required to write out a “living will” that details exactly how you’ll pay the bills if you fail, because the rest of us aren’t bailing you out ever again. And if you’re a <a class="extiw" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mortgage_loan" title="w:Mortgage loan">mortgage lender</a> or a <a class="extiw" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Payday_loan" title="w:Payday loan">payday lender</a> or a <a class="extiw" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Credit_card" title="w:Credit card">credit card</a> company, the days of signing people up for products they can’t afford with confusing forms and deceptive practices are over. Today, American consumers finally have a watchdog in <a class="extiw" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Richard_Cordray" title="w:Richard Cordray">Richard Cordray</a> with one job: to look out for them. 
</p>, <p>We will also establish a Financial Crimes Unit of highly trained investigators to crack down on large-scale fraud and protect people’s investments. Some financial firms violate major anti-fraud laws because there’s no real penalty for being a repeat offender. That’s bad for consumers, and it’s bad for the vast majority of bankers and financial service professionals who do the right thing. So pass legislation that makes the penalties for fraud count. 
</p>, <p>And tonight, I am asking my <a class="extiw" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Attorney_General" title="w:United States Attorney General">Attorney General</a> to create a special unit of federal prosecutors and leading state attorneys general to expand our investigations into the abusive lending and packaging of risky mortgages that led to the housing crisis. This new unit will hold accountable those who broke the law, speed assistance to homeowners, and help turn the page on an era of recklessness that hurt so many Americans. 
</p>, <p>A return to the American values of fair play and shared responsibility will help us protect our people and our economy. But it should also guide us as we look to pay down our debt and invest in our future.  Right now, our most immediate priority is stopping a tax hike on 160-million working Americans while the recovery is still fragile. People cannot afford losing $40 out of each paycheck this year. There are plenty of ways to get this done. So let’s agree right here, right now: no side issues. No drama. Pass the payroll tax cut without delay. 
</p>, <p>When it comes to the deficit, we’ve already agreed to more than two-trillion dollars in cuts and savings. But we need to do more, and that means making choices. Right now, we’re poised to spend nearly a trillion dollars more on what was supposed to be a temporary tax break for the wealthiest two-percent of Americans. Right now, because of loopholes and shelters in the tax code, a quarter of all millionaires pay lower tax rates than millions of middle-class households. Right now, <a class="extiw" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Warren_Buffett" title="w:Warren Buffett">Warren Buffett</a> pays a lower tax rate than his secretary.
</p>, <p>Do we want to keep these tax cuts for the wealthiest Americans? Or do we want to keep our investments in everything else, like education and medical research, a strong military, and care for our veterans? Because if we’re serious about paying down our debt, we can’t do both.
</p>, <p>The American people know what the right choice is. So do I. As I told the <a class="extiw" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Speaker_of_the_United_States_House_of_Representatives" title="w:Speaker of the United States House of Representatives">Speaker</a> this summer, I’m prepared to make more reforms that rein in the long term costs of <a class="extiw" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Medicare_(United_States)" title="w:Medicare (United States)">Medicare</a> and <a class="extiw" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Medicaid" title="w:Medicaid">Medicaid</a>, and strengthen <a class="extiw" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Social_Security_(United_States)" title="w:Social Security (United States)">Social Security</a>, so long as those programs remain a guarantee of security for <a class="extiw" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Senior_citizen" title="w:Senior citizen">seniors</a>. 
</p>, <p>But in return, we need to change our tax code so that people like me, and an awful lot of Members of <a class="extiw" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Congress" title="w:United States Congress">Congress</a>, pay our fair share of taxes. Tax reform should follow the Buffett rule: if you make more than a million dollars a year, you should not pay less than 30% in taxes. And my Republican friend <a class="extiw" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tom_Coburn" title="w:Tom Coburn">Tom Coburn</a> is right: <a class="extiw" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Washington,_D.C." title="w:Washington, D.C.">Washington</a> should stop subsidizing millionaires. In fact, if you’re earning a million dollars a year, you shouldn’t get special tax subsidies or deductions. On the other hand, if you make under $250,000 a year, like 98% of American families, your taxes shouldn’t go up. You’re the ones struggling with rising costs and stagnant wages. You’re the ones who need relief.  
</p>, <p>Now, you can call this <a class="extiw" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Class_struggle" title="w:Class struggle">class warfare</a> all you want. But asking a <a class="extiw" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Billionaire" title="w:Billionaire">billionaire</a> to pay at least as much as his secretary in taxes? Most Americans would call that <a class="extiw" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Common_sense" title="w:Common sense">common sense</a>.
</p>, <p>We don’t begrudge financial success in this country. We admire it. When Americans talk about folks like me paying my fair share of taxes, it’s not because they envy the rich. It’s because they understand that when I get tax breaks I don’t need and the country can’t afford, it either adds to the deficit, or somebody else has to make up the difference – like a senior on a fixed income; or a student trying to get through school; or a family trying to make ends meet. That’s not right. Americans know it’s not right. They know that this generation’s success is only possible because past generations felt a responsibility to each other, and to their country’s future, and they know our way of life will only endure if we feel that same sense of shared responsibility. That’s how we’ll reduce our deficit. That’s an America built to last.
</p>, <p>I recognize that people watching tonight have differing views about taxes and debt; energy and health care. But no matter what party they belong to, I bet most Americans are thinking the same thing right now: nothing will get done this year, or next year, or maybe even the year after that, because Washington is broken.  <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Barack_Obama_Weekly_Address_-_28_January_2012" title="Barack Obama Weekly Address - 28 January 2012">Can you blame them for feeling a little cynical</a>? 
</p>, <p>The greatest blow to confidence in our economy last year didn’t come from events beyond our control. It came from a debate in Washington over whether the United States would pay its bills or not. Who benefited from that fiasco?
</p>, <p>I’ve talked tonight about the deficit of trust between <a class="extiw" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Main_Street" title="w:Main Street">Main Street</a> and <a class="extiw" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wall_Street" title="w:Wall Street">Wall Street</a>. But the divide between this city and the rest of the country is at least as bad, and it seems to get worse every year.
</p>, <p><a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Barack_Obama_Weekly_Address_-_28_January_2012" title="Barack Obama Weekly Address - 28 January 2012">Some of this has to do with the corrosive influence of money in politics. So together, let’s take some steps to fix that. Send me a bill that bans insider trading by Members of Congress, and I will sign it tomorrow. Let’s limit any elected official from owning stocks in industries they impact. Let’s make sure people who bundle campaign contributions for Congress can’t lobby Congress, and vice versa</a>, an idea that has bipartisan support, at least outside of Washington. 
</p>, <p>Some of what’s broken has to do with the way Congress does its business these days. A simple majority is no longer enough to get anything, even routine business, passed through the <a class="extiw" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Senate" title="w:United States Senate">Senate</a>. Neither party has been blameless in these tactics. Now both parties should put an end to it. For starters, I ask the Senate to pass a rule that all judicial and public service nominations receive a simple up or down vote within 90 days.
</p>, <p>The <a class="extiw" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Executive_(government)" title="w:Executive (government)">executive branch</a> also needs to change. Too often, it’s inefficient, outdated and remote. That’s why I’ve asked this Congress to grant me the authority to consolidate the federal bureaucracy so that our Government is leaner, quicker, and more responsive to the needs of the American people. 
</p>, <p>Finally, none of these reforms can happen unless we also lower the temperature in this town. We need to end the notion that the two parties must be locked in a perpetual campaign of mutual destruction; that politics is about clinging to rigid ideologies instead of building consensus around common sense ideas. 
</p>, <p>I’m a <a class="extiw" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Democratic_Party_(United_States)" title="w:Democratic Party (United States)">Democrat</a>. But I believe what <a class="extiw" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Republican_Party_(United_States)" title="w:Republican Party (United States)">Republican</a> <a href="/wiki/Author:Abraham_Lincoln" title="Author:Abraham Lincoln">Abraham Lincoln</a> believed: that Government should do for people only what they cannot do better by themselves, and no more. That’s why my education reform offers more competition, and more control for schools and States. That’s why we’re getting rid of regulations that don’t work. That’s why our health care law relies on a reformed private market, not a Government program. 
</p>, <p>On the other hand, even my Republican friends who complain the most about Government spending have supported federally-financed roads, and clean energy projects, and federal offices for the folks back home. 
</p>, <p>The point is, we should all want a smarter, more effective Government. And while we may not be able to bridge our biggest philosophical differences this year, we can make real progress. With or without this Congress, I will keep taking actions that help the economy grow. But I can do a whole lot more with your help. Because when we act together, there is nothing the United States of America can’t achieve. 
</p>, <p>That is the lesson we’ve learned from our actions abroad over the last few years.  Ending the <a class="extiw" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Iraq_War" title="w:Iraq War">Iraq War</a> has allowed us to strike decisive blows against our enemies. From <a class="extiw" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pakistan" title="w:Pakistan">Pakistan</a> to <a class="extiw" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yemen" title="w:Yemen">Yemen</a>, the al-Qaeda operatives who remain are scrambling, knowing that they can’t escape the reach of the United States of America.
</p>, <p>From this position of strength, we’ve begun to wind down the <a class="extiw" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/War_in_Afghanistan_(2001%E2%80%93present)" title="w:War in Afghanistan (2001–present)">War in Afghanistan</a>. Ten thousand of our troops have come home. Twenty-three thousand more will leave by the end of this summer. This transition to Afghan lead will continue, and we will build an enduring partnership with Afghanistan, so that it is never again a source of attacks against America.
</p>, <p>As the tide of war recedes, a wave of change has washed across the <a class="extiw" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Middle_East" title="w:Middle East">Middle East</a> and <a class="extiw" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/North_Africa" title="w:North Africa">North Africa</a>, from <a class="extiw" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tunis" title="w:Tunis">Tunis</a> to <a class="extiw" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cairo" title="w:Cairo">Cairo</a>; from <a class="extiw" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sana%27a" title="w:Sana'a">Sana’a</a> to <a class="extiw" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tripoli" title="w:Tripoli">Tripoli</a>. A year ago, <a class="extiw" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Muammar_Gaddafi" title="w:Muammar Gaddafi">Gaddafi</a> was one of the world’s longest-serving dictators, a murderer with American blood on his hands. Today, he is gone. And in <a class="extiw" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Syria" title="w:Syria">Syria</a>, I have no doubt that the <a class="extiw" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hafez_al-Assad" title="w:Hafez al-Assad">Assad</a> regime will soon discover that the forces of change can’t be reversed, and that human dignity can’t be denied.
</p>, <p>How this incredible transformation will end remains uncertain. But we have a huge stake in the outcome. And while it is ultimately up to the people of the region to decide their fate, we will advocate for those values that have served our own country so well. We will stand against violence and intimidation. We will stand for the rights and dignity of all human beings; men and women; <a class="extiw" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Christian" title="w:Christian">Christians</a>, <a class="extiw" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Muslim" title="w:Muslim">Muslims</a>, and <a class="extiw" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jew" title="w:Jew">Jews</a>. We will support policies that lead to strong and stable democracies and open markets, because tyranny is no match for liberty.
</p>, <p>And we will safeguard America’s own security against those who threaten our citizens, our friends, and our interests. Look at <a class="extiw" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Iran" title="w:Iran">Iran</a>. Through the power of our diplomacy, a world that was once divided about how to deal with Iran’s nuclear program now stands as one. The regime is more isolated than ever before; its leaders are faced with crippling sanctions, and as long as they shirk their responsibilities, this pressure will not relent. Let there be no doubt: America is determined to prevent Iran from getting a nuclear weapon, and I will take no options off the table to achieve that goal. But a peaceful resolution to this issue is still possible, and far better, and if Iran changes course and meets its obligations, it can rejoin the community of nations.
</p>, <p>The renewal of American leadership can be felt across the globe. Our oldest alliances in <a class="extiw" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Europe" title="w:Europe">Europe</a> and <a class="extiw" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Asia" title="w:Asia">Asia</a> are stronger than ever. Our ties to the <a class="extiw" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Americas" title="w:Americas">Americas</a> are deeper. Our iron-clad commitment — and I mean ironclad — to <a class="extiw" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Israel" title="w:Israel">Israel</a>’s security has meant the closest military cooperation between our two countries in history. We’ve made it clear that America is a <a class="extiw" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pacific_Ocean" title="w:Pacific Ocean">Pacific</a> power, and a new beginning in <a class="extiw" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Burma" title="w:Burma">Burma</a> has lit a new hope. From the coalitions we’ve built to secure nuclear materials, to the missions we’ve led against hunger and disease; from the blows we’ve dealt to our enemies, to the enduring power of our moral example: America is back. 
</p>, <p>Anyone who tells you otherwise, anyone who tells you that America is in decline or that our influence has waned, doesn’t know what they’re talking about. That’s not the message we get from leaders around the world, all of whom are eager to work with us. That’s not how people feel from <a class="extiw" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tokyo" title="w:Tokyo">Tokyo</a> to <a class="extiw" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Berlin" title="w:Berlin">Berlin</a>; from <a class="extiw" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cape_Town" title="w:Cape Town">Cape Town</a> to <a class="extiw" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rio_de_Janeiro" title="w:Rio de Janeiro">Rio</a>; where opinions of America are higher than they’ve been in years. Yes, the world is changing; no, we can’t control every event. But America remains the one indispensable nation in world affairs, and as long as I’m President, I intend to keep it that way. 
</p>, <p>That’s why, working with our military leaders, I have proposed a new defense strategy that ensures we maintain the finest military in the world, while saving nearly half a trillion dollars in our budget. To stay one step ahead of our adversaries, I have already sent this Congress legislation that will secure our country from the growing danger of <a class="extiw" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cyberterrorism" title="w:Cyberterrorism">cyber-threats</a>.
</p>, <p>Above all, our freedom endures because of the men and women in uniform who defend it. As they come home, we must serve them as well as they served us. That includes giving them the care and benefits they have earned, which is why we’ve increased annual <a class="extiw" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Department_of_Veterans_Affairs" title="w:United States Department of Veterans Affairs">VA</a> spending every year I’ve been President. And it means enlisting our veterans in the work of rebuilding our Nation.
</p>, <p>With the bipartisan support of this Congress, we are providing new tax credits to companies that hire vets. <a class="extiw" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Michelle_Obama" title="w:Michelle Obama">Michelle</a> and <a class="extiw" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jill_Biden" title="w:Jill Biden">Jill Biden</a> have worked with American businesses to secure a pledge of 135,000 jobs for veterans and their families. And tonight, I’m proposing a Veterans Job Corps that will help our communities hire veterans as cops and firefighters, so that America is as strong as those who defend her.
</p>, <p>Which brings me back to where I began. Those of us who’ve been sent here to serve can learn from the service of our troops. When you put on that uniform, it doesn’t matter if you’re <a class="extiw" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/African_American" title="w:African American">black</a> or <a class="extiw" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/White_American" title="w:White American">white</a>; <a class="extiw" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Asian_American" title="w:Asian American">Asian</a> or <a class="extiw" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hispanic_and_Latino_Americans" title="w:Hispanic and Latino Americans">Latino</a>; <a class="extiw" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conservatism_in_the_United_States" title="w:Conservatism in the United States">conservative</a> or <a class="extiw" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Liberalism_in_the_United_States" title="w:Liberalism in the United States">liberal</a>; <a class="extiw" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wealth" title="w:Wealth">rich</a> or <a class="extiw" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Poverty" title="w:Poverty">poor</a>; <a class="extiw" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Homosexuality" title="w:Homosexuality">gay</a> or <a class="extiw" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Heterosexuality" title="w:Heterosexuality">straight</a>. When you’re marching into battle, you look out for the person next to you, or the mission fails. When you’re in the thick of the fight, you rise or fall as one unit, serving one Nation, leaving no one behind.
</p>, <p>One of my proudest possessions is the flag that the <a class="extiw" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Naval_Special_Warfare_Development_Group" title="w:United States Naval Special Warfare Development Group">SEAL Team</a> took with them on <a class="extiw" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Death_of_Osama_bin_Laden" title="w:Death of Osama bin Laden">the mission to get bin Laden</a>. On it are each of their names. Some may be Democrats. Some may be Republicans. But that doesn’t matter. Just like it didn’t matter that day in the <a class="extiw" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/White_House_Situation_Room" title="w:White House Situation Room">Situation Room</a>, when I sat next to <a class="extiw" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Robert_Gates" title="w:Robert Gates">Bob Gates</a>, a man who was George Bush’s defense secretary; and <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Author:Hillary_Clinton" title="Author:Hillary Clinton">Hillary Clinton</a>, a woman who <a class="extiw" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hillary_Clinton_presidential_campaign,_2008" title="w:Hillary Clinton presidential campaign, 2008">ran against me for president</a>. 
</p>, <p>All that mattered that day was the mission. No one thought about politics. No one thought about themselves. One of the young men involved in the raid later told me that he didn’t deserve credit for the mission. It only succeeded, he said, because every single member of that unit did their job: the pilot who landed the helicopter that spun out of control; the translator who kept others from entering the compound; the troops who separated the women and children from the fight; the <a class="extiw" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Navy_SEALs" title="w:United States Navy SEALs">SEALs</a> who charged up the stairs. More than that, the mission only succeeded because every member of that unit trusted each other.
